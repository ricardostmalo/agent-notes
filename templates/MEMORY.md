# MEMORY.md

Curated, durable memory for a repo.

Use this for decisions, lessons learned, and stable context that should persist across sessions.

## Architecture Decisions

- (example) Ack-and-queue for webhooks with hard SLA.

## Lessons Learned

- (example) Prefer scripts for verification, not manual dashboard checks.
